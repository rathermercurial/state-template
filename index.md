# DAO State Repository

Welcome to the DAO State Repository. This resource serves as the central source of truth for all information related to governance structure, agreements, and collective decision-making processes. By maintaining these records in a consistent, accessible format, we enable transparency, accountability, and informed participation by all members.

## What is a DAO State Repository?

A DAO State Repository functions as the formal record of a decentralized organization's governance. It contains the collective agreements that define how the organization operates, makes decisions, and evolves over time. This repository is version-controlled to provide a reliable history of governance changes and is designed to empower all members with the information they need to participate effectively.

## Table of Contents

- [State](#state)
- [Agreements](#agreements)

- [Operating Agreement](agreements/operating_agreement.md) - Legal framework for the organization

## Using This Repository

### For New Members

If you're new to the organization, we recommend starting with the State section to understand the purpose and structure, followed by the Agreements to learn about rights and responsibilities within the DAO.

### For Active Contributors

Active contributors should familiarize themselves with the Policies section to effectively participate in organizational decision-making.

### For Working Group Leaders

Those leading working groups should reference the Operational Policies for guidance on coordinating activities and managing resources within the organization.
