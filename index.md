## What is a DAO State Repository?

A DAO State Repository functions as the formal record of a decentralized organization's governance. It contains the collective agreements that define how the organization operates, makes decisions, and evolves over time. This repository is version-controlled to provide a reliable history of governance changes and is designed to empower all members with the information they need to participate effectively.
