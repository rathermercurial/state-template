# DAO State Repository

The daoName state repository is a resource for information related to governance activity, agreements and norms within the DAO. This library was built to provide a central source of truth, and to empower all DAO members with a way to directly affect DAO governance by proposing new initiatives, working groups and policies.

<!-- Briefly describe your DAO's governance here. -->

You can learn more about daoName's governance process on the [Governance Overview](dao/overview.md) page.
