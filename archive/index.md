# üóÉÔ∏è Governance Archives

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Modify this introduction to reflect your organization's approach to archives -->
The Governance Archives preserve the history of our collective decision-making, serving as the institutional memory of the organization and providing transparency into our evolution. This section contains historical proposals, treasury approvals, and documentation of governance milestones.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Adapt this section to highlight the importance of archives in your context -->
## Why Archives Matter

Archives play several important roles in decentralized governance:

- **Transparency**: They provide a record of decisions and their implementation
- **Onboarding**: They help new members understand how the organization has evolved
- **Accountability**: They allow members to verify that approved decisions were implemented
- **Learning**: They contain valuable insights from past experiences
- **Continuity**: They maintain organizational knowledge across changing membership

## Archive Organization

The archives can be organized in various ways to suit your organization's needs. A common approach includes:

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Update to reflect your proposal archive structure -->
### Proposal Archives

The Proposal Archive typically contains governance proposals that have been formally submitted for consideration, such as:

- Approved proposals that have been implemented
- Rejected proposals that did not receive sufficient support
- Withdrawn proposals that were removed before voting

Proposals often include the original text, voting outcomes, and implementation details.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Update to reflect your treasury records approach -->
### Treasury Records

Treasury records might document resource allocations, including:

- Transactions involving assets
- Contract deployments
- Permission updates

Organizations typically maintain connections between transactions and the proposals that authorized them.

### Repository History

Git's version control system provides a built-in way to track changes to the repository itself:

- Commit history shows changes chronologically
- Pull requests can provide context for significant changes
- Blame view helps identify who made specific changes and why
- Compare view allows examination of differences between versions

## Using the Archives

Archives can serve different purposes for different members of the organization:

### For New Members

If you're new to the organization, you might find it helpful to:

- Start with significant proposals to understand key decisions
- Review recent proposals to see current focus areas
- Explore treasury activities to understand resource allocation
- Browse repository history to see governance evolution

### For Governance Participants

When participating in governance, archives can help you:

- Research similar past proposals
- Reference previous decisions in discussions
- Connect proposals to their implementation
- Understand the organization's governance norms

## Finding Information

There are several ways to locate information within the archives:

### Search Options

- **Keyword search**: Using repository search with specific terms
- **Directory browsing**: Navigating through archive folders
- **Content search**: Searching within specific documents
- **Git history**: Searching commit messages or content changes

### Reference Formats

When referencing archive materials in discussions or proposals, you might consider a format like:

```
[Proposal Title](link-to-proposal) (Status, Date)
```

For example:
```
[Implement Governance Structure](link-to-proposal) (Approved, Date)
```

## Archive Timeline

Archives typically reflect the organization's governance history from inception to present. New materials may be added as governance processes complete, creating an ongoing record of collective decisions.
