# DAO State Repository Governance

This document establishes the framework for maintaining and evolving the DAO State Repository. In decentralized organizations, governance documentation serves as both a record of collective decisions and a guide for future actions, providing a transparent, version-controlled history of the DAO's agreements, policies, and decisions.

## Purpose and Principles

The DAO State Repository functions as the canonical record of the organization's governance state, representing the collective agreements that define how the organization operates and evolves. Unlike traditional documentation that often becomes outdated or fragmented, this repository ensures a comprehensive and auditable history of all governance changes.

The repository operates on several foundational principles: it serves as a single source of truth for current policies; maintains transparency through visible, attributable changes; implements due process through established procedures; ensures alignment between documentation and actual governance decisions; and prioritizes accessibility by structuring information to be understandable for all members.

## Relationship Between Repository and Governance

The repository documents governance decisions rather than creating them. This critical distinction means that repository changes should only reflect legitimate decisions made through the DAO's established processes. Only modifications approved through proper governance channels may be incorporated, preserving the system's integrity. The act of updating the repository implements but does not itself constitute a governance decision, ensuring that governance remains a deliberative process while the repository serves as its faithful record.

## Change Process

Changes to the repository follow a structured process reflecting the organization's commitment to transparent governance. The process begins with proposal creation according to established standards. Proposals must clearly articulate the suggested changes and rationale, including exact text modifications.

Before formal decision-making, proposals undergo community discussion and refinement. The author shares their suggestion in designated forums, allowing time for feedback. This deliberation often improves the original proposal as authors incorporate community input.

After sufficient discussion, proposals move to formal decision-making through the DAO's established voting process. The finalized proposal is submitted for a vote, with voting periods conforming to the governance policies. For approval, the proposal must meet or exceed required thresholds.

Implementation typically occurs through pull requests or change requests that implement the exact changes specified in the approved proposal. These requests reference the approved proposal and undergo review by designated maintainers. All changes are documented in the DAO State Changes log, and proposals are archived for future reference.

## Repository Maintenance

Designated maintainers handle the technical aspects of the repository, preserving its integrity by reviewing and merging approved changes. These maintainers need both technical skills and an understanding of the DAO's governance model to implement changes that align with its intentions.

Despite their technical authority, maintainers operate within clear limitations: they may only implement properly approved changes, can make minor formatting adjustments that don't affect substance, but may never overrule governance decisions. Different types of changes follow proportional approval processes â€“ substantive governance changes require formal proposals and voting, while minor technical maintenance may be performed with documentation but without formal proposals.

## Resolving Conflicts

The governance system includes mechanisms to address disputes constructively. Interpretation disagreements regarding governance documents are resolved according to processes defined in the operating agreement. Technical implementation disputes are handled by repository maintainers with appropriate oversight. Members who believe a repository change misrepresents an approved decision can utilize an appeals process through the DAO's dispute resolution policy.

This governance document itself follows the same change process as other governance documents, ensuring that meta-rules remain subject to the same standards of deliberation and approval as other governance matters.
