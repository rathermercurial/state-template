# üîè DAO State Repository

{% hint style="warning" %}
This resource is a template. Fill in this doc repository with your own DAO's information to create a DAO State Repository.&#x20;

A minimal set of policies and standards is included to serve a narrow governance scope, constrained to **metagovernance only**. You can adjust the scope to suit your needs by adding additional policies and proposal standards to the [Policies & Agreements](broken-reference) section.

Fields <mark style="color:yellow;">highlighted in yellow</mark> should be edited to suit your DAO's needs and brand.

For best results, please sync this repo to GitBook to create a friendly UI. You can find a production example here: [https://state.allinforsport.org/](https://state.allinforsport.org/)
{% endhint %}

The <mark style="color:yellow;">daoName</mark> state repository is a resource for information related to governance activity, agreements and norms within the DAO. This library was built to provide a central source of truth, and to empower all DAO members with a way to directly affect DAO governance by proposing new initiatives, working groups and policies.
