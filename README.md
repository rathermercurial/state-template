# üîè DAO State Repository Template

A simple template for documenting, maintaining, and evolving DAO governance through git-based workflows.

## What is a DAO State Repository?

A DAO State Repository serves as the canonical source of truth for all governance activities, agreements, and policies within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Unlike traditional documentation that can become outdated or fragmented across multiple platforms, this repository provides:

- **A Single Source of Truth**: Centralized, version-controlled governance documentation
- **Transparent History**: Complete audit trail of all governance changes
- **Accessible Governance**: Clear pathways for members to understand and participate in governance
- **Proposal Tracking**: Standardized processes for submitting, discussing, and implementing governance changes
- **Treasury Accountability**: Transparent records of financial decisions and transactions

This template is designed to help DAOs establish robust governance documentation practices, ensuring that all members have equal access to information about how the organization operates, makes decisions, and evolves over time.

## Git-Based Governance: Concept and Value

Using git as the foundation for DAO governance documentation aligns naturally with the decentralized ethos of web3 organizations. At its core, this approach leverages the distributed, transparent, and immutable properties of git repositories to create governance systems that mirror the values of blockchain technology.

### Why Git for Governance?

Git provides several fundamental properties that make it ideal for governance:

- **Distributed nature**: Like blockchains, git allows multiple parties to maintain copies of the entire history
- **Transparency**: All changes are visible, attributable, and timestamped
- **Immutability**: Historical records cannot be altered without detection
- **Branch-based exploration**: Enables experimentation and parallel governance proposals
- **Merge processes**: Provides clear mechanisms for integrating changes after approval

### Bridging Onchain and Offchain Governance

For onchain organizations, git-based governance documentation creates a natural bridge between onchain actions (voting, treasury management, permission updates) and the human-readable context and rationale behind those actions. This connection helps maintain alignment between:

- Smart contract implementations and their intended purposes
- Technical parameters and their governance justifications
- Treasury transactions and their authorized purposes

The repository becomes not just documentation, but a living system that evolves alongside the onchain components of the organization, providing context and continuity that blockchain transactions alone cannot express.

## Deployment Options

This DAO State Repository template can be deployed in several ways, depending on your organization's needs and technical capabilities:

### GitHub Repository

The most direct approach is to use GitHub to host your governance repository. This provides native version control, pull request workflows, and issue tracking capabilities that align perfectly with governance processes.

### Documentation Platforms

For a more user-friendly presentation, you can connect your repository to documentation platforms:

- **GitBook**: Offers a clean, navigable interface while maintaining GitHub as the backend
- **GitHub Pages**: Presents your repository as a website with minimal configuration
- **Docusaurus**: Provides advanced documentation features for more complex needs

### Integration Options

No matter which platform you choose, consider how your governance repository will integrate with:

- Your organization's main website
- Communication platforms (Discord, Discourse, etc.)
- Voting systems (Snapshot, Tally, etc.)
- Treasury management tools

Detailed deployment guides will be provided in future documentation. For now, focus on customizing the content to match your organization's governance structure and needs.
