# Policies Directory

This directory is designed to store your organization's policies - the guidelines, procedures, and standards that inform how your organization operates. How you structure and use this space depends entirely on your governance model and organizational needs.

## About This Directory

The policies directory serves as a place to document your organization's approach to governance and operations. What you include here and how you organize it should reflect your unique context and priorities.

You might use this space to document:
- Decision-making processes
- Resource allocation guidelines
- Operational procedures
- Platform and tools management
- Communication norms
- Or any other aspects of governance relevant to your organization

## Getting Started

This template includes a basic directory structure you can modify to suit your needs. Feel free to:
- Rename directories to better reflect your terminology
- Add new directories for your specific governance areas
- Remove directories that don't apply to your model
- Rearrange the structure to match your organizational logic

The included structure is just one possible approach - your organization may benefit from a completely different organization method based on your size, activities, and governance philosophy.

## Example Directory Structure

The included structure organizes policies into broad categories:

```
policies/
├── README.md              # This information file
├── index.md               # Optional overview page
├── metagovernance/        # Policies about governance itself
├── administration/        # Platform and system policies
└── operations/            # Day-to-day activity policies
```

This structure is meant as a starting point - adapt it freely. Some organizations might prefer to organize by working group, by function, by stakeholder group, chronologically, or using an entirely different approach.

## Documentation Considerations

As you document your policies, you might find it helpful to consider:

- **Accessibility** - How easily can members find and understand relevant policies?
- **Maintenance** - What process will keep documentation current as policies evolve?
- **Versioning** - How will you track changes to policies over time?
- **Context** - What background information helps explain why policies exist?
- **Scope** - How clearly defined are the boundaries of each policy?

These considerations aren't requirements but may help you create documentation that serves your organization's needs.

## Integration with Your Governance

Effective policy documentation typically connects with your broader governance practices. You might consider how this documentation relates to:

- Your proposal and decision-making processes
- Member onboarding and education
- External communications and transparency
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Operational tools and platforms

The value of this documentation comes from how well it integrates with and supports your actual governance activities, whatever form they take.

This directory is yours to shape according to your organization's unique needs and practices. The suggestions here are offered as possibilities to consider, not as requirements to follow. Your governance model should drive how you use this space, not the other way around.
