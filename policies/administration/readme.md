# Platform Administration Policies

Many DAOs have policies which direct and constrain the administration of their collectively-owned platforms. You can use this directory to record those policies so they're discoverable in a centralized location. This helps members understand how the organization works.

When recording platform administration policies it can be useful to group them by the specific platforms in question, or by domains of delegated policymaking authority created via a metagovernance proposal. This helps DAO members and workstreams use the DAO state effectively while keeping the repository organized and readable.
