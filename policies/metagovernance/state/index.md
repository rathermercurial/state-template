# State Management Policies

This section documents how updates to the DAO state repository are managed. These policies ensure that all changes to governance documentation follow established processes and properly reflect collective decisions.

## About State Management

The state repository serves as the canonical record of governance decisions and policies. Its integrity depends on ensuring that all changes accurately reflect legitimate governance decisions and follow consistent documentation standards.

## State Update Process

The process for updating the repository typically includes:

1. **Proposal**: Changes begin with a formal proposal following the [proposal standards](../proposals/)
2. **Decision**: The community decides on the proposal through established governance processes
3. **Implementation**: Approved changes are implemented in the repository
4. **Verification**: Changes are reviewed to ensure they match the approved proposal
5. **Documentation**: The change and its authorization are recorded in the archive

## Repository Maintainer Role

Repository maintainers are responsible for implementing approved changes and maintaining documentation quality. This role requires:

- Technical skills for repository management
- Understanding of governance processes
- Commitment to documentation accuracy

Maintainers' authority is limited to implementing legitimate governance decisions and maintaining documentation quality.
