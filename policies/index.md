# Policy Registry

This registry contains policies that define how your organization operates and makes decisions. These policies establish procedures, standards, and guidelines for organizational activities and resource allocation.

## Understanding Policies

Policies create frameworks for consistent decision-making and action. Unlike agreements (which focus on relationships between participants), policies govern systems, processes, and organizational functions. Clear policies reduce decision fatigue and enable predictable operations while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.

### Types of Policies

* **Governance Policies** - Define how collective decisions are made and implemented
* **Operational Policies** - Guide day-to-day activities and resource allocation
* **Administrative Policies** - Govern platforms, tools, and organizational systems
