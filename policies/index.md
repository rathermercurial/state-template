# Policy Registry

This registry contains policies that define how your organization operates and makes decisions. These policies establish procedures, standards, and guidelines for organizational activities and resource allocation.

## Understanding Policies

Policies create frameworks for consistent decision-making and action. Unlike agreements (which focus on relationships between participants), policies govern systems, processes, and organizational functions. Clear policies reduce decision fatigue and enable predictable operations while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.

## Types of Policies

Your organization might use several types of policies:

* **Governance Policies** - Define how collective decisions are made and implemented
* **Operational Policies** - Guide day-to-day activities and resource allocation
* **Administrative Policies** - Govern platforms, tools, and organizational systems
* **Communication Policies** - Establish standards for internal and external communications

## Current Policies

<!-- CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION: Replace these examples with your organization's actual policies -->

* [Proposal Process](metagovernance/proposals/index.md) - How new initiatives are proposed and approved
* [Treasury Management](operations/treasury.md) - Guidelines for managing collective resources
* [Access Control](administration/access.md) - Procedures for managing permissions and security

## How to Customize This Registry

To adapt this registry for your organization:

1. Replace the placeholders with your actual policies
2. Update descriptions to match your organization's terminology
3. Add or remove policy categories based on your governance model
4. Link to existing documents when creating new entries
5. Consider organizing policies into subdirectories if they become numerous

As your organization evolves, maintain this registry by documenting new policies and updating existing ones through your established governance processes.
