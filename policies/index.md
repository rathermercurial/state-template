# DAO Policies

These policies constitute the body of principles by which the DAO (including its platforms, systems, roles and protocols) will operate and self-govern in the fulfillment of its purpose.

Policies are distinct from [agreements](/agreements/index.md), which reify the social contract held between members of the DAO.
