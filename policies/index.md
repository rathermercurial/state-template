## Understanding Policies

Policies create frameworks for consistent decision-making and action. Unlike agreements (which focus on relationships between participants), policies govern systems, processes, and organizational functions. Clear policies reduce decision fatigue and enable predictable operations while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.
