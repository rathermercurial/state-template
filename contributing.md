# Maintaining Your DAO State Repository

This guide covers best practices for maintaining your DAO State Repository once it's in production. It focuses on update workflows, version control, and ongoing management of your governance documentation.

You should customize this guide to suit your governance workflow and context. This is an example starting place you can use to begin crafting your contribution guidelines.

## Repository Maintenance Principles

Effective governance documentation maintenance is built on several key principles:

1. **Accuracy and Currency**: Documentation should reflect current governance
2. **Transparency**: All changes should be visible and traceable
3. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform formatting and organization
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure documentation remains easy to navigate

## File and Directory Organization

The repository uses a three-part structure to organize governance documentation:

- **Agreements**: Commitments among participants
- **Policies**: Procedures and standards
- **Archives**: Historical records

Maintaining this organization helps ensure documentation remains accessible and coherent.

### File Naming and Organization

Maintain consistent file naming conventions:

1. **Use lowercase** for all filenames
2. **Replace spaces** with underscores or hyphens
3. **Use descriptive names** that clearly indicate content
4. **Maintain consistency** across similar documents

## Commit Message Standards

Well-structured commit messages improve clarity:

```
Update [document name]: [brief description]

[Optional longer explanation]
[Reference to proposal/issue number]
```

Examples:
- "Update operating_agreement.md: Add dispute resolution process"
- "Fix broken links in policies/index.md"
- "Archive proposal-12: Implementation complete"
