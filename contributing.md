# Maintaining Your DAO State Repository

This guide covers best practices for maintaining your DAO State Repository once it's in production. It focuses on update workflows, version control, and ongoing management of your governance documentation.

## Repository Maintenance Principles

Effective governance documentation maintenance is built on several key principles:

1. **Accuracy and Currency**: Documentation should reflect current governance
2. **Transparency**: All changes should be visible and traceable
3. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform formatting and organization
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure documentation remains easy to navigate

## File and Directory Organization

The repository uses a three-part structure to organize governance documentation:

- **Agreements**: Commitments among participants
- **Policies**: Procedures and standards
- **Archives**: Historical records

Maintaining this organization helps ensure documentation remains accessible and coherent.

### File Naming and Organization

Maintain consistent file naming conventions:

1. **Use lowercase** for all filenames
2. **Replace spaces** with underscores or hyphens
3. **Use descriptive names** that clearly indicate content
4. **Maintain consistency** across similar documents

### Commit Message Standards

Well-structured commit messages improve clarity:

```
Update [document name]: [brief description]

[Optional longer explanation]
[Reference to proposal/issue number]
```

Examples:
- "Update operating_agreement.md: Add dispute resolution process"
- "Fix broken links in policies/index.md"
- "Archive proposal-12: Implementation complete"

## Recommended Maintenance Practices

### Link Management

Maintain the integrity of internal references:

1. **Check for broken links** when documents are moved or renamed
2. **Update references** in other documents
3. **Use relative paths** for internal links
4. **Verify navigation files** (index.md) remain current

### Regular Reviews

Establish a schedule for documentation review:

1. **After governance changes**: Update affected documents promptly
2. **Periodic audits**: Review entire repository for accuracy
3. **After major organizational changes**: Ensure documentation reflects current structure

### Roles and Responsibilities

Define who is responsible for documentation maintenance, for example:

1. **Proposal authors**: Responsible for initial documentation of their proposals
2. **Governance team**: Oversees documentation standards and organization
3. **Community members**: Can suggest improvements and report issues

### Contributor Guidelines

Establish clear guidelines for contributions:

1. **Document procedure** for suggesting changes
2. **Define approval process** for updates
3. **Provide templates** for common documents
4. **Set quality standards** for contributions

By following these maintenance practices, your DAO State Repository will remain an accurate, accessible resource that evolves alongside your organization's governance.
