# Agreements Directory Guide

This directory contains the agreements that define relationships between members, groups, and the broader organization. This guide provides information on managing agreement documentation within your governance repository.

## About Agreements

Agreements serve as the social contracts that establish expectations, rights, and obligations within your organization. They define how participants relate to each other and the collective, creating a foundation for decentralized collaboration.

Unlike policies (which govern systems and processes), agreements focus on relationships and mutual commitments. Well-documented agreements help autonomous groups and individuals act independently while remaining aligned with organizational purpose.

## Directory Structure Examples

The starter template includes just a few sample agreements in the root agreements folder. As your organization grows, you might find it helpful to organize agreements into subdirectories.

Below is an example directory structure for inspiration. This is not a requirement or even a suggestion - it's simply one approach to organization that some DAOs have found useful:

```
agreements/
├── README.md              # This guide (for contributors)
├── index.md               # Overview for members
├── membership/            # Agreements for all members
│   ├── values.md          # Shared values
│   ├── code_of_conduct.md # Behavioral expectations
│   └── operating_agreement.md # Foundational framework
├── roles/                 # Role-based agreements
├── groups/                # Working group agreements
└── network/               # External relationships
    └── partnerships.md    # Partnership agreements
```

You should organize your agreements in whatever way makes the most sense for your organization's structure, governance model, and documentation needs. Many organizations start with all agreements in the root folder and only create subdirectories when the number of agreements becomes unwieldy.

## Agreement Document Components

When creating agreement documents, you might consider including these elements to ensure clarity and usability:

* **Purpose Statement** - Explains why the agreement exists and what it aims to accomplish. This provides context and helps with future interpretation.

* **Scope** - Defines who is bound by the agreement and under what circumstances it applies. This clarity helps prevent misunderstandings about when and where the agreement is relevant.

* **Terms** - Contains the specific commitments, rights, and obligations established by the agreement. This forms the core content that defines the relationship.

* **Amendment Process** - Explains how changes to the agreement can be proposed and approved. This creates transparency about how the agreement can evolve.

* **Effective Date/Version** - Helps track when the agreement was last updated, providing important context as your organization evolves.

## Managing Agreement Documentation

### Creating New Agreements

When adding new agreements to your repository, consider maintaining consistency in format to improve readability. You might find it helpful to link related agreements when appropriate, creating a network of connected documents.

Remember to add new agreements to your documentation index to ensure discoverability. Follow your organization's established process for ratifying new agreements to ensure legitimacy and awareness.

### Updating Agreements

Your organization will evolve over time, and your agreements should evolve with it. Version control systems help track changes to agreement documents, providing transparency about how they have changed.

When making significant changes, document the rationale behind them to provide context for future reference. Update effective dates when agreements change to maintain a clear timeline of evolution.

Always follow your governance process for amendments to ensure changes maintain legitimacy. Communicate changes to affected participants to ensure awareness and maintain transparency.

## Integration with Governance Processes

Your agreements directory will naturally connect with other aspects of your governance system. Consider how your agreement documentation interacts with:

* **Proposal System** - Defines how new agreements are proposed and approved. This connection ensures that agreements go through appropriate review and consent processes.

* **Onboarding Process** - Determines how new members learn about and consent to agreements. This helps ensure that all participants understand their commitments.

* **Dispute Resolution** - Clarifies how agreement interpretations are resolved when questions arise. This provides a path forward when understanding differs.

* **Amendment Procedures** - Defines the formal process for how agreements evolve over time. This ensures changes follow established governance norms.
