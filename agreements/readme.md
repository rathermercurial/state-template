# Agreements Directory

This directory contains foundational documents that define relationships and expectations within your organization. These social contracts establish the foundation for how members interact and collaborate.

*The example agreements in this directory are to help inspire you to consider what agreements exist within your organization. You should modify or replace these agreements with your organization's actual agreements established through a consensus process.*

## Purpose

Agreements define the social contracts between members and the organization. While policies govern systems and processes, agreements focus on relationships and mutual commitments. Well-crafted agreements enable autonomous action while maintaining alignment with your shared purpose.

## Implementation Approach

### Essential Agreements

Most organizations begin with these core agreements:

- **Operating Agreement** - The foundational legal framework
- **Code of Conduct** - Standards for community interaction
- **Community Guidelines** - Norms and shared practices

### Organization Patterns

As your organization evolves, you might organize agreements in different ways:

- **By Member Type** - Different agreements for core contributors vs. community members
- **By Scope** - Internal agreements vs. external partnerships
- **By Function** - Governance agreements vs. operational agreements

## Agreement Structure

Effective agreements typically include:

- **Purpose Statement** - Why the agreement exists
- **Scope** - Who is bound by the agreement and when
- **Terms** - Specific commitments, rights, and obligations
- **Amendment Process** - How the agreement can evolve
- **Effective Date** - When the agreement was last updated

## Integrating with Governance

Your agreements connect directly with other governance processes:

- **Proposal System** - How agreements are proposed and approved
- **Onboarding** - How new members consent to agreements
- **Dispute Resolution** - How disagreements about agreements are resolved
