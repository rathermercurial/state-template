# Agreement Registry

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Modify this introduction to reflect your organization's approach to agreements -->
This registry contains agreements that define relationships within your organization. These agreements establish expectations, rights, and obligations for members and groups. 

## Understanding Agreements

Agreements create the foundation for coordination by making expectations explicit. Unlike policies (which govern systems), agreements focus on relationships between people and groups. Clear agreements enable autonomous action while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Adapt this section to reflect your agreement types -->
## Types of Agreements

Your organization might use several types of agreements:

* **Membership Agreements** - Define the relationship between individual members and the organization
* **Group Agreements** - Govern how teams work together and interface with the rest of the organization
* **Role Agreements** - Clarify the authority and responsibilities of specific functions
* **Network Agreements** - Establish relationships with external partners and stakeholders

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Replace these examples with your organization's actual agreements -->
## Current Agreements

* [Operating Agreement](operating_agreement.md) - The legal framework for our organization
* [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) - Behavioral expectations for all participants
* [Community Guidelines](community_guidelines.md) - Norms and shared practices

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Update this information with your maintenance process -->
As your organization evolves, maintain this registry by documenting new agreements and updating existing ones through your established governance processes.
