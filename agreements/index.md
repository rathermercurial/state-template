# Agreements

These agreements reflect and record the mutually-held decisions made by and among individual members regarding their participation in the DAO.

Agreements are distinct from [policies](/policies/index.md), which are expectations and statements of intent meant to constrain the functionality of the DAO's platforms and protocols, as well as the authority of its role owners.

## [Membership Agreements](/agreements/membership/index.md)

These agreements represent the DAO's terms of membership. By joining and remaining in the DAO, members signal their assent to these agreements.
