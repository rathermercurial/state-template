# Agreement Registry

This registry contains agreements that define relationships within your organization. These agreements establish expectations, rights, and obligations for members and groups. 

## Understanding Agreements

Agreements create the foundation for coordination by making expectations explicit. Unlike policies (which govern systems), agreements focus on relationships between people and groups. Clear agreements enable autonomous action while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.

## Types of Agreements

Your organization might use several types of agreements:

* **Membership Agreements** - Define the relationship between individual members and the organization
* **Group Agreements** - Govern how teams work together and interface with the rest of the organization
* **Role Agreements** - Clarify the authority and responsibilities of specific functions
* **Network Agreements** - Establish relationships with external partners and stakeholders

## Current Agreements

<!-- CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION: Replace these examples with your organization's actual agreements -->

* [Operating Agreement](operating_agreement.md) - The legal framework for our organization
* [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) - Behavioral expectations for all participants
* [Community Guidelines](community_guidelines.md) - Norms and shared practices

## How to Customize This Registry

To adapt this registry for your organization:

1. Replace the placeholders with your actual agreements
2. Update descriptions to match your organization's terminology
3. Add or remove agreement categories based on your governance model
4. Link to existing documents when creating new entries
5. Consider organizing agreements into subdirectories if they become numerous

As your organization evolves, maintain this registry by documenting new agreements and updating existing ones through your established governance processes.
